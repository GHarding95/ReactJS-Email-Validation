# Email Validation

Test for valid email addresses using set constraints below, made with HTML, CSS & React JS.

Email is split into its local and domain parts to perform the following checks:

// Check if the local and domain names are non-empty // Check the local name does not start with a '+' character // Check if the email is not too long (< 100) // Check if the domain ends with one of the allowed suffixes (.com, .co.uk, .org, .mail & .gov // Check if the domain has at least one character before the suffix (this means there must be at least one text character after the @ symbol and before any of the allowed suffixes so that example@.com is not validated)

Valid email addresses are confirmed with a pop up message and are then logged in the console as a JSON object
